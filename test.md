Evaluation Considerations
Time Limit: 3 Hours (No extra time for pushing to GitHub)
• It is essential to complete all the steps listed in the Pre-Test Setup document prior to
working on the below test.
• Mandatory Logging Integration: Wherever you're tasked with writing code, your
implementation MUST extensively use the Logging Middleware you created in the
Pre-Test Setup stage. Use of inbuilt language loggers or console logging is not allowed.

Campus Notifications Microservice
Deliverables
• You're a developer working on a campus notification platform where students receive
real-time updates regarding Placements, Events, and Results. You have to incrementally
solve different tasks across stages. Each stage has clear instructions on the deliverables.
You're expected to commit and push your deliverables to the same GitHub Repository
that you created while implementing the Logging Middleware at frequent intervals.
Direct submission of your response at the end of the test as a single commit will result in
lower points for your submission.
• As you progress through the stages, you may revise your submission for the previous
stages. Your submission will be
evaluated across stages both individually and
cumulatively.
• At different stages of the task, there may be references to other roles within the team
(like frontend developer, product manager, architect, etc.) and those are provided only as
imaginary roles that they shall play. At no point should you consult or discuss your
strategy or submissions with your peers. This is not a team activity.
Stage 1
The campus notifications application has been running for a few weeks.
You've received
feedback from users that they lose track of important notifications because of the high volume
of notifications. Your product manager has asked you to introduce a Priority Inbox that always
displays the top 'n' most important unread notifications first (n could be top 10,15, 20, etc. as
per user's choice). Priority should be determined based on a combination of weight (placement
> result > event) and recency. Implement your approach or solution in any language of your
choice (Go, Rust, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Java etc). Write code only to find top 10
notifications (DB query is not expected). Your submission should be an actual functioning code
file and not pseudo-code. You're also expected to upload screenshots of your output displaying
the priority notifications. Both the code and the screenshots are to be pushed to the same
GitHub repository. Also note that new notifications will keep coming in. How will you maintain
the top 10 efficiently? In addition to the code and screenshots, explain your approach in a
markdown file called "Notification_System_Design.md" to the same repository you created while
creating the logging middleware. Label your response with "Stage 1" as heading.

To simplify your task, you're also provided with the below Notification API. You are expected to
use the API to fetch the notifications.
Note: You need not store the notifications in a database, nor are you supposed to hard-code or
create notifications yourself. You're not expected to develop an Ul or frontend in this stage.

Stage 2
You've received a go-ahead from your software architect to implement the frontend for the
application. You are to develop a responsive React/Next (Use of other non-React based
frameworks is not permitted) application that displays all Notifications as well as priority
Notifications (enabling display of limited top "n" notifications as well as filter on notification type)
on a different page. You're expected to distinguish between new and already viewed
notifications by relying on suitable frontend implementation. Submit your response as a new
sub-directory within the same Github repository along with a video recording of your
application's pages and funcionality (both desktop and mobile views). Your React/Next
application must run exclusively on http://localhost:3000. Care must be taken to avoid cluttering
the page. The Ul must prioritise user experience, with a focus on highlighting key elements of
each page. Your application must adhere to all specified API and frontend requirements and
general constraints, demonstrating robust error handling, high code quality, and efficient API/UI
design suitable for a production environment. Use Material Ul only for styling. If you are not
familiar with Material Ul, use native CSS. Use of ShadCN or other CSS Libraries is prohibited.
Solely relying on native CSS or not using Material Ul will result in lower scores.
